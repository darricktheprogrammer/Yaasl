(*!
 * Library for interacting with the user.
 *
 * Mostly contains shortcuts that help exclude error handling inline, or focus
 * the dialog window, which does not always happen by default.

(*!
 * Choose from list convenience function.
 *
 * Displays a `choose from list` dialog, ensuring that the dialog has focus
 * when displayed. `choose_from_list` also handles the basic error handling
 * (such as error -128 user cancelled).
 *
 * Note that multiple items _are_ allowed to be chosen. If you choose to use
 * this function and are only expecting one value returned, you will have to get
 * the first item of the returned list.
 *
 * @example set choices to {1, 2, 3}
 *          set choice_prompt to "How many times would you like to repeat?"
 *          set repeat_num to item 1 of choose_from_list(choices, choice_prompt, item 1 of choices)
 *          --> 1
 *
 *
 * @param List The list for the user to choose from
 * @param String The text prompt, describing to the user what they are choosing
 * @param String The list item to highlight by default. If that option is not in
 *               the list, no default will be highlighted
 * @return List

(*!
 * Display dialog convenience function.
 *
 * Displays a `display dialog` dialog, ensuring that the dialog has focus
 * when displayed. `display_dialog` also handles some basic button handling if
 * text input is not needed.
 *
 * @param String The text to be presented to the user.
 * @param [List, String] Either a list of button names, or default text to create
 *                       text input box. In this implementation, the two are
 *                       mutually exclusive. If you need text input,
 *                       and multiple button options, this function will not
 *                       work for you.
 *
 * 						 When given a list of buttons, the buttons are added to
 * 						 the dialog from left right with the rightmost button
 * 						 being the default. For example, `{"Cancel", "Okay"}`
 * 						 would add a `Cancel` button on the left, an `Okay`
 * 						 button on the right, and set `Okay` as
 * 						 the default button choice.
 * @return String

(*!
 * Choose folder convenience function
 *
 * The main difference between this and vanilla `choose_folder` is that by
 * default, `choose_folder` starts in the current Finder window. So, if the front
 * Finder window has selected "~/Pictures/baby_pictures" that will be where the
 * prompt opens up to begin with. If there are no open Finder windows, the
 * default location will be ~/Desktop.
 *
 * Multiple selections are allowed.
